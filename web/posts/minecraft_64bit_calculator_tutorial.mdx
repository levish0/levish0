## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This project covers how to implement a calculator in Minecraft. It explores concepts such as understanding binary arithmetic operations, performing base conversion using bitwise shifting, and more.

**Our goal is to create a 64-bit integer calculator.**

First and foremost, you need to have an understanding of binary numbers. While we use the decimal system with numbers from 0 to 9 in our everyday lives, computers operate differently. They rely on a binary system that uses only 0 and 1 to handle everything. For example, in our decimal system, we would say that 6 + 7 equals 13. However, in the binary system that computers use, it would be represented as 110 + 111, which equals 1101.

``110 = 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 6``  
``111 = 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 7``  
``1101 = 1*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 = 1*2^0 = 13``

These are examples of it.

The second topic is about logic gates. You might have heard the names of logic gates such as AND, NOR, XOR, OR, and so on at least once. A logic gate is an idealized or physical device that performs a Boolean function, a logical operation performed on one or more binary inputs that produces a single binary output. We will use these to implement bitwise arithmetic operations.

### AND
The AND operation, also known as the logical conjunction, is a binary operation that takes two input bits and produces an output bit. The output bit is set to 1 only if both input bits are also 1; otherwise, it is set to 0. In other words, the AND operation returns 1 if and only if both inputs are 1; otherwise, it returns 0.

Here's the truth table for the AND operation:
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Input A</td>
        <td>Input B</td>
        <td>Output</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
</table>

### XOR
The XOR operation, also known as the exclusive OR, is a binary operation that takes two input bits and produces an output bit. The output bit is set to 1 if the input bits are different (one is 0 and the other is 1); otherwise, it is set to 0. In other words, the XOR operation returns 1 if the inputs are different; otherwise, it returns 0.

Here's the truth table for the XOR operation:
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Input A</td>
        <td>Input B</td>
        <td>Output</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
</table>

That's enough to build a full adder.

It consists of two XOR gates, one AND gate, and an additional carry-in (C-in) input.

The following is an explanation of how binary arithmetic operations are performed on binary numbers:

### Binary Addition
- Binary addition is performed similar to regular decimal addition.
Add the corresponding bits from the two binary numbers, starting from the rightmost bit (LSB).
- If the sum of two bits is 0 or 1, write the sum in the result.
- If the sum is 2, write 0 and carry over 1 to the next left bit.
Continue this process until all bits are added, considering any carry overs.

### Binary Subtraction
- Binary subtraction is performed similar to regular decimal subtraction.
Subtract the corresponding bits from the two binary numbers, starting from the rightmost bit (LSB).
- If the minuend bit is greater than or equal to the subtrahend bit, write the difference in the result.
- If the minuend bit is smaller, borrow 1 from the next left bit and adjust the result accordingly.
Continue this process until all bits are subtracted.

### Binary Multiplication
- Binary multiplication is performed similar to regular decimal multiplication.
Multiply the multiplicand by each bit of the multiplier, starting from the rightmost bit (LSB).
- Write the partial products in different rows, shifting them to the left based on their bit position.
- Add the partial products together to obtain the final product.

### Binary Division
- Binary division is performed similar to regular decimal division.
Divide the dividend by the divisor, bit by bit, starting from the leftmost bit (MSB).
- Compare the dividend bits with the divisor bits and perform the division operation.
- Subtract the divisor from the dividend and write the quotient bit based on the result.
- Repeat this process until the entire dividend is divided, and the remaining bits are the remainder.

And we also need to go through the process of converting these binary numbers back to decimal numbers for our use. 

We will use the [Double dabble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_dabble) algorithm to accomplish this task.

As an example of the Double dabble algorithm using 243:
```
0000 0000 0000 11110011 Initialization
0000 0000 0001 11100110 Shift
0000 0000 0011 11001100 Shift
0000 0000 0111 10011000 Shift
0000 0000 1010 10011000 Add 3 to ONES, since it was 7
0000 0001 0101 00110000 Shift
0000 0001 1000 00110000 Add 3 to ONES, since it was 5
0000 0011 0000 01100000 Shift
0000 0110 0000 11000000 Shift
0000 1001 0000 11000000 Add 3 to TENS, since it was 6
0001 0010 0001 10000000 Shift
0010 0100 0011 00000000 Shift
2    4    3
```
Following this procedure, we will repeat the Double dabble algorithm for the exponent value to obtain our original value.

By mapping the 4-bit values to their respective segments on a 7-segment display, we can create a representation that visually displays the converted values in decimal form for us.

**Congratulations on gaining enough knowledge to build a calculator!**

First, circuitry operations within Minecraft require a significant amount of repetitive and simple tasks. Therefore, we will install Minecraft Forge and download a few useful modules. You only need two things. The first is the essential **WorldEdit** mod, and the second is **Optifine** and **BSL** shaders, which will enhance the visuals of Minecraft. **Optifine** and **BSL** are not mandatory but are simply my preferences.

You can download each of them through the following links:

- [Minecraft Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/)
- [WorldEdit mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/worldedit)
- [Optifine](https://optifine.net/)
- [BSL Shaders](https://bitslablab.com/bslshaders/)
- [Redstone Tweaks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMhlv0AnTmg)

Please note that these links are provided for convenience, but it's always recommended to verify the authenticity and compatibility of the files before downloading and installing them.
