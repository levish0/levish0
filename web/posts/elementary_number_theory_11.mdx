## Definition
**A positive integer $n$ is said to be *perfect* if $n$ is equal to the sum of all its positive divisors, excluding $n$ itself.**

## Theorems
- **If $2^k-1$ is prime $(k > 1)$, then $n = 2^{k-1}(2^k-1)$ is perfect and every even perfect number is of this form.**  

Let $2^k-1 = p$, a prime, and consider the integer $n=2^{k-1}p$. Then, $$\sigma(n) = (2^k-1)(p+1) = (2^k-1)2^k = 2n$$ Hence, n is a perfect number.  
Conversely, let's assume that $n$ is a even perfect number. we can write $n=2^{k-1}m$ where m is an odd integer and $k\geq 2$. Then, $$\sigma(n) = \sigma(2^{k-1})\sigma(m) = (2^k-1)\sigma(m) = 2n = 2^km,$$ $$2^km=(2^k-1)\sigma(m),$$ It means $(2^k-1) | m$ so, we may write $m = (2^k-1)M$. By substituting this value, $$2^kM=\sigma(m) \geq m + M = 2^kM$$
Leading to $\sigma(m) = m+M$, it means that m has only two positive divisors and it's prime.
